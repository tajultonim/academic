While the functional value at `pos` is negative or the functional value at `neg` is positive, we will try to find the value for `pos` and `neg`. As by definition they are the value of `x` at which the function evaluates to a positive and a negative value respectively. For each iteration we check if the functional value at a point that is `i` more than the starting guess is positive or negative. If positive and we haven't find the `pos` value then we assign it this value. Same goes for the `neg`. We will also check for the value of `x` that is `i` less than the starting guess. If somehow for any value of `x` the function evaluatesto zero then set it as the root and exit the loop."

At first we will check if the `avg` is the same as the averae value which will imply that the value of `x` will no longer change or we have reached an recursion. Usually it means wehave found the root for the precision of floats python gives us. In that case we will exit the loop. Otherwise we will assign the `avg` variable to the average of `pos` and `neg`. Then we will evaluate the function at the average. If the functional value at `avg` is positive we will assign the `pos` with this value of `avg`. And for negative we will assign `neg`. And in case the funcitonal value is `0`, it's a root for the polynomial thus we can assign `res` to this value of `avg` and exit the loop."
