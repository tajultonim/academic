As by definition they are the value of `x` at which the function evaluates to a positive and a negative value respectively. For each iteration we check if the functional value at a point that is `i` more than the starting guess is positive or negative. If positive and we haven't find the `pos` value then we assign it this value. Same goes for the `neg`. We will also check for the value of `x` that is `i` less than the starting guess.

While we don't find a value for `res` or result, we will continue fake position loop. At first we will check if the `newx` is going to be the same as the previous which will imply that the value of `x` will no longer change or we have reached an recursion. Usually it means wehave found the root for the precision of floats python gives us. In that case we will exit the loop. Otherwise we will assign the `newx` variable to the next guess we obtain from the current values of `pos` and `neg`. Then we will evaluate the function at the point `newx`. If the functional value at `newx` is positive we will assign the `pos` with this value of `newx`. And for negative we will assign `neg`. And in case the funcitonal value is `0`, it's a root for the equation thus we can assign `res` to this value of `newx` and exit the loop.\n",
